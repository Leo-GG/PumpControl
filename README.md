# PumpControl
Control program for Arduino-based peristaltic pump

This is the software I wrote with [Cinzia](https://www.iit.it/people/cinzia-sgambato) during a session of the [Code Clinic@CABHC](https://leo-gg.github.io/CodeClinicCABHC/). 

The pump is a 3D printed [design by silisand](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1134817) and it runs with a NEMA17 motor (plus few bearings and screws). The motor is driven by a A4988 stepper driver connected to an Arduino nano.

The software consists of a small program for the Arduino and a Processing sketch to control it through a GUI.
